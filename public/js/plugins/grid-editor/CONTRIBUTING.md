If you want to help out and submit a pull request, great! Please follow these rules:

* Make sure you read and understand BUILDING.md
* Make sure every pull request only includes 1 fix or 1 new function, not many
* If you add new functionality, also add a full example to README.md
* Follow the coding style in the existing files
* Make sure your pull request is eslint clean by running `eslint src`
* Only submit the files in the `src` directory. I'll make a new build if your PR is accepted.

Thanks!
